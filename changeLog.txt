                                                                                                                        NOTES
changing "dimensions" (? why called that?) to "lineToParse"                                                         
removing Matrix.dimension, used only for printing purposes, so I'll have matrix.print() set it when it's called 
changing datatype of matrix from int to byte, lots of space to be saved
main writes the matrix and list to file for every new response                                                          is this a good idea?
