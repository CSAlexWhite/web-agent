Hi there.
There were some great times. 
We'll talk about love, and lust, and faking it. 
I am an open book. 
She tells us why she dated jerks, and if she's found somebody new. 
For the most part, I'm a home body. 
Plus, Chelsea Handler stops by. The naked truth from Jenny McCarthy is next on LARRY KING LIVE. Jenny McCarthy, I don't know why it's funny. Actress, comedienne, "New York Times" best- selling author. And her new book is "Love, Lust, and Taking It: The Naked Truth about Sex, Lies, and True Romance". We welcome her back to LARRY KING LIVE.
And I have a confession to make to you. Put the book up again. I was offered to do the cover, but I was too busy. So they found this substitute. Look at him. 
You know what? I wish you were available. 
You wanted me? 
I wanted you so bad. 
I know. 
I don't think you would have wore the mullet though. I would have enjoyed being in your arms, Larry. 
What -- don't do that. 
Here we go. We got an hour. 
Why did you write this? 
Well, it happened to be that I thought of the cover first, about a year and a half ago. I woke up in bed and went, I want to do a knock-off of a Harlequin novel. And I don't know if I want to write a Harlequin novel that's funny, or actually write about my disastrous love life and sex stories. And right around the time that I was going through my own breakup, which I'm sure we will get to, Larry. 
I think we will. 
You know, I made a deal to do this. And then I was going through the breakup while writing this book. And I feel it was meant to be. 
So you changed from writing a novel, which would have been a satire Harlequin? 
Yes, exactly. 
Yes.
To everything I was experiencing in love and looking back at my last relationships, down the road, and, you know, how women fake it in relationships. I really had like this breakthrough, so to speak, and thought why not write this book, maybe help some women in their relationships to either learn how to stay in it or learn when to get the hell out of it. 
Did you read romance novels? 
I read a few by VC Andrews back when I was working at a Polish grocery store. 
VC Andrews wrote science fiction, didn't he? 
I don't know if it's VC Andrews or V something Andrews. 
Okay.
No, but it was like all these weird books, like Harlequin novels, but they were all about incest. I'm like why are people reading this and liking it? So I stopped reading the novels. 
But you used your Twitter account, as I understand it, to survey people about some of the subjects in this book. 
Yes. 
And were you surprised how candid people were? 
You know, on Twitter, people are very candid. That's why they'll tell you how awful you looked on TV or how great you looked. And I have such a wide variety of fans, so to speak. I have like these great warrior moms, but I also have perverts in prison. So I have this great scope of people to ask these questions to. And I was really surprised by a lot of the responses, and how truthful they were about what goes on in their bedroom. 
One looks at you and, and you use the word disastrous love life. How could you, really, with your personality and that face, how could you have a disastrous love life? 
I guess I shouldn't call it disastrous, but there are some disastrous sex stories, because let me tell you I wasn't so good in the beginning. But in terms of love life, or love choices, you know, I feel like I wasn't necessarily in the right place like we are all. But the teacher showed up when the student was ready for it. And I had different teachers, which I call ex-boyfriends, and taught me some great things, but they just didn't work out. 
Were you ever dumped? I know you write about dumped in the book. Does someone dump you? 
Yes. I did. Tony Lobianco at one point was my husband. 
Tony? I know Tony. 
Tony, well, he's also an actor. 
Of course he's -- he's a terrific actor. 
I did not date that one. I dated the younger version of Tony Lobianco in high school. He was my high school sweetheart from the time I was 12 till I was like 19. 
And he dumped you? 
We had a breakup in the middle where he dumped me for a full summer to check out more meat at the deli during spring break. So I was just horrified and crying in bed, and just devastated. I mean, I was brought to my knees back then. And looking back, you know, I go, everyone's always like looking back to their, you know, first loves. Like in the book, I write searching for Tony Lobianco. And people are on Facebook looking for their first loves again. And I go why are people so fascinated by this? Why do they want to go backwards in time? 
You never forget your first, right? 
True. And you know what I realized? There's not much luggage going into the first relationship. It's like a clean slate. 
There's no luggage. 
It's afterwards, you're bringing all of JFK and LAX luggage with you and projecting onto your--
How many times would you say, Jenny, you have been in love? Jenny? 
I would say about five, six times. I've loved every boyfriend I've had. And I still love them. But I feel look we -- some people have more soul mates than others. So. 
We can't leave it alone. So let's go to it and then we'll go back to the book. 
Yes, yes, yes.
What happened with Jim Carrey? You know, when I did the bathroom scene with him on "Letterman."
That was hilarious, by the way.
Hilarious. The two of us in a bathtub together, champagne. 
That was like the best moment of TV.
You were going with him then. 
Yes I was. And I thought it was hilarious. 
And you talked about him. And he talked about your son. 
Yes.
And you were so happy. 
So happy. 
What happened? 
Well, you know, everything that we talked about in terms of, admiration for one another and respect and love was absolutely true and is true. In the moments, there were some great times. And I'm so grateful for him standing by me through those autism years, and being so kind to Evan, and being an amazing boyfriend. But like with a lot of relationships in Hollywood, you don't necessarily see what goes on when things aren't maybe so great. And we both looked at each other. 
What was the difference do you think? In other words, what caused, you know, I don't have a right to-- 
You know I can't get into specifics, but I'll give you what I can. 
I know that, but what would you say was the key to this attractive, funny, outgoing personality couple, the key that didn't work? 
The key that didn't work was probably us both growing and changing like everyone does in opposite directions. And we kind of got to that point, rather quickly towards the end that said, you know what? We're both seeing that maybe we're not going in the same direction anymore. And let's end in peace, not war. 
So it did end in peace? 
It did end in peace. And I'm so grateful. 
Do you keep in touch? 
We do. And just, you know, mutual respect and admiration and-- 
Knowing Jim and having talked to Jim, when he was in love was madly in love. I mean, Jim was 100 percent. 
And I think we would both say, still, you know, very much, very much have respect and love for each other. But, you know, I look back and look at the lessons learned. And I go wow. He was an amazing teacher for five years. 
He tweeted it out about the breakup. Were you surprised at that? 
No, I tweeted right after. I tell you the little inside scoop to that, Larry. 
Please. 
Well, like most celebrity breakups, they don't usually happen at the time the media finds out. There is some time. Isn't that something?
They don't know, the media? 
They don't know.
Okay.
They're not that quick. Well--
So what happened? 
So there was some time to kind of mend both of our hearts, because no matter whose decision it was in the break-up, it does take time to grieve and get over it. So we did have a little bit of a cushion. And then we got a phone call that said the magazines are coming out tomorrow. They found out. And so, we both decided to do it on our own terms. We didn't want to go through the media machine like when celebrities break up, you have to like make a statement, go through the press wire. You know, and it's just a bunch of bull. So we just said let's do it in the new social media world, and you know, bow out gracefully with a lot of respect. KING: Was it -- do you cry? Do you, how do you handle, you've had breakups? 
I've had breakups. And yes, of course you cry. 
Is there a good rule for breaking up? 
Well, I went to my therapist. And she had said, you know, no matter what, any relationship or marriage that I've had in the past, too, you grieve the loss of the relationship. There's somewhat of a feeling of failure that you have to mourn of going "God, you know, the dreams that you had in your head are, that's all they were, just dreams. It's ending." And you have to go inside and then make a new routine. I do remember once I moved back in my house, I looked around and went I don't know how to--
Move here.
--move. It's like, you know. 
There's a mourning. It's mourning. 
It is. 
Jenny McCarthy's our guest. If I have to tell you that, you're on another planet. The book, "Love, Lust and Faking It." If there is ever a guaranteed best-seller, this. And if I was on the cover. Major. We'll be right back with Jenny after this. 
That's right, 100 people who have nothing better to do with their lives except to be on MTV's "Singled Out."
Jenny, what about these 50 single women?
Chris, these ladies are hungry for love. Let's serve them a thick slice of a man. Bring him out right now.
Jenny McCarthy is our special guest for the -- actually, she did that when she was 11. Our King cam cruise, by the way, the book, "Love, Lust and Faking It," our King cam crews went out to get questions for Jenny. A lot of fans want to know, of course, about the situation with Jim Carrey. Here's one from Los Angeles. Watch. 
Hi, Jenny, I am a big fan. I was wondering how the breakup with you and Jim Carrey had an effect on your son, if that was really hard for him to understand? 
Good question. 
It is a good question. You know, I was worried about that more than anything. 
Because he's autistic or just because he's-- 
Well, he's no longer autistic, but because he's a child. And because they had a very strong connection. I was worried, what, if he would feel abandoned or -- I don't know what? But I looked at my own parents, who stayed in the relationship a little too long. They were married 30 years. And they probably should have gotten divorced at 10 years. So, I knew that I was making the right decision because it was making me happy. And if that is a good reflection for my son to look at, I thought is the best teacher I could be. I did have a conversation with him. I told him that we will be moving into our old house. I never sold my old house, and that we will send Jimmy love hearts from this house. 
Does he talk to Jimmy? 
hello
I'm still here.
how are you?
Terrible.
really?
What is wrong?
nothing
Huh?
What.
Nothing much.
How are you?
Yo
what's new?
That's good.
what's good?
How are you?
I'm great!
That's good.
There were some great times. 
We'll talk about love, and lust, and faking it. 
I am an open book.

Good question. 
It is a good question. You know, I was worried about that more than anything. 
Because he's autistic or just because he's-- 
Does he talk to Jimmy? 
Does he talk to his father? 
Oh, yeah. He definitely does. 
Do he wasn't like losing a man relationship in his life? 
Correct, no. 
That's important. 
It is. 
How would you describe you and Jim now? Friends? 
Yes, absolutely on friendly terms. And I think he's in New York right now shooting a movie. And I couldn't be happier for him. 
How funny is he in the house? 
He was funny. I mean, you know, he's, to me one of the best comedian actors in the world. 
The best. 
And just great and had great characters with Evan. And really good guy. 
When you were so open in the relationship--
Yes. KING: --where you appeared together on this show. 
Right. 
Maybe too open? 
No, I am an open book, which is why I think maybe people respect it. I don't -- I have a problem lying or, you know, not being my authentic self to the public, because I think you can get in a lot of trouble that way. So everything I stated with him of being open in love was absolutely true. It's just like--
So no regrets? 
Absolutely not. No, not at all. Like I look back and go, I'm so grateful and have no, no regrets. 
Wouldn't he -- I would guess this, that he would be awfully hard to replace? In other words, are you going to find someone funnier? No? Better looking? No. 
Well, I believe in positive affirmations, and think that the universe is friendly, and always has something better for you if you believe it. 
Are you seeing someone now? 
I am currently seeing someone. I'm calling it very light dating. Nothing too serious. Just kind of-- 
Not living together-- 
--gliding. No, no, just, you know, I'm just not double dipping. I'm exclusively-- 
When someone's right, are you exclusive with him? 
Yes, that's right. 
So that's not light? 
It's not? 
I don't think so. 
Well, I'm not planning, you know, I'm moving in, I'm not planning on running down the aisle. I'm just know that I'm doing a lot of work on myself and in making sure I'm happy before I really-- 
What does he do? 
He owns an eye mask company called "Eye Dos." 
Does the person you -- because of your own economic stature, does the man you're with -- what are you looking for? Does the man have to have well to do? MCCARTHY: No. Let me tell you, I would take chubby and hairy if they were a nice guy. I don't care. 
Wait a minute, you're getting 6,000 chubbies. 
I've dated chubby and hairy and a little bald and didn't mind. The thing is I want a reflection of who I am now. And that is coming into relationships really happy, really whole. I don't want to look at my partner and have expectations on them to fill up my potholes, which mean my insecurities. 
Don't you think it's hard for a man to approach you? I mean, look at the average guy. You think hairy and baldy and curly and blobbo are going to come over and say, hey, let's go out. 
I'm hoping so. But I do -- I have heard I'm a little bit intimidating. 
No kidding. 
Well, I don't understand why. I don't know, it's because I'm just very blunt and honest or strong. 
And pretty. 
I don't know. I don't know. You know, but I hope that when, when, you know, the time is right, you know. 
Before this relationship, would you be home a lot on Saturday night? 
Oh, my God, yeah. I'm still home a lot. I mean, the only reason I've been out is my house has been renovated for the past, the whole summer. But for the most part, I am a home body. 
We'll come back with another King cam question. And we'll talk about faking it. 
Ooh. 
And I think I know what she means. Don't go away. 
How a man should dress to get lucky. Get rid of any starched clothes if you're going out on a date or going clubbing. No creases. Little wrinkle is good. Mimic your favorite male celebrity. See what they wear. They're probably getting luckier than you are. 
Wow. How old were you there? How much younger were you? 
I was probably 29 there. KING: How old are you, do you tell your age now? 
Yeah, 37. I don't care. 
All right, Jenny's our guest. The book, "Love, Lust, and Faking It." We'll talk about faking it. But we've got another King cam question. This one's from New York. Take a look. 
Hi, Jenny. I was wondering what's the worst date you've ever been on? 
Good question. You write about negatives in the book. 
I do.
What's the worst? 
The worst, I do write about this guy called the Teletubby. I dated this Teletubby. 
Teletubby.
I named him that because he was the chubby hairy guy that I dated, but he was a real jerk. Like-- 
Like? 
I gave him a chance because I thought, this is all subconsciously, this is me going back looking at it. I thought that a chubby, hairy man would make a great husband because -- I would be a catch for him. And he would-- 
Don't you have to want him physically? 
You know, I never really was into the look parts. I mean, if you kind of like looked back and posted all my ex's, you'd go, boy, she is like a smorgasbord. 
Except Jim Carrey. 
Yeah, he's good looking. 
So what happened with him, Teletubby? 
So you mean the Teletubby. I went over to his house. He didn't have a house. He was living in one of the shacks that you like buy at Wal-mart. And he didn't even have a bed. It was look a 15 blankets on the ground. And there was raccoons living next to us. And I'm thinking to myself, what am I doing? Like, I'm young. I'm cute. 
He must have been thrilled out of his mind. MCCARTHY: You would think so. 
He wasn't? 
No, he was a real jerk. And I thought to myself, you know, he's going to make a great dad, because he'll never cheat on me or leave me, because I'm cute. 
No, he won't. Yes.
And he was -- he turned out to be a jerk. So I wound up dumping him. 
Did you break his heart or not? 
Oh, no, no, no. 
What's the faking it part? 
Well, I'm glad you asked. A lot of people think it's about orgasms, but it's not because women already know how to do that quite well. This faking it in my book is about women entering relationships being their authentic self. You know, you meet someone, and there's this like honeymoon phase where you laugh at everything they say, oh, you want to watch Anderson Cooper, I'm loving it, but secretly they hate it. You know, so it's like this truth serum that I'm trying to teach women that I've learned a lesson with to go in being you. 
But the man is doing the same thing, isn't he?
You know, I--
Love everything you say. Right, correct. 
I think he's doing it for a much shorter period. I think their goal is sex. And I think our goal-- 
Really? 
Yes. 
Go ahead.
I mean, this is my observation.
Okay.
It's like you're going to, you know, manipulate the girl to get in bed. Whereas a woman will manipulate and play this acting game so that they can appear as the most wonderful woman this man has ever met. And usually we can hold out for about two years until we're going, switch the channel. You know, and I hate your uncle. You know, so, I'm just, the whole thing is about, like what, let's wake up while we're doing that, while we're trying to manipulate our man or being fake and just be real. KING: So you're saying be real from the get go. 
From the get go. You're going to save two years. You know, and in two years, you know, as you're getting older, that's some pretty important years. 
By the way, you're seeing someone, but it's not serious, serious? You're not-- 
It just started. So for me to say serious, serious, well, you know, he can like go, whoa, slow down. But if I say it's not serious, then he'll go what's the deal? So--
Are you scared of being alone? 
I was scared of being alone. Good question, Larry. No one asked me that yet. But yes, I had a really big fear of being alone, so much so that I went from boyfriend, like, almost lined up the next one, boyfriend, almost lined up the next one, because I had this deep fear of being alone. And--
How did you get over that? 
Just in this last breakup. I did a lot of--I mean, mind you, I've been broken up now for a while. But I did a lot of time with Byron Katie, who's a spiritual philosopher, and learned a lot about myself, and why I would have been scared of being alone. And--
You learned a lot? 
I did. I think self-realization and realizing you don't need a lover in your life to have love in your life was my biggest lesson.
Be right back with Jenny McCarthy with more King cam questions. "Love, Lust and Faking It," subtitled the naked truth about "Sex, Lies, and True Romance". If you don't buy the book just on the cover, you're nuts. We'll be right back. 
We have another King cam question for Jenny McCarthy. Her new book, just out from Harper. This one is about love and lust, which is in the title. Watch. 
Hey, Jenny, I would like to know the difference between love and lust. Can you tell me that? 
Love is such a powerful energy. Love can kill you. We are love, though, which is what I've been learning a lot from Byron Katie. It is the most wonderful force you have. It's only thing you can take with you when you die. 
And it can make you very sad. 
It can. As I said, love can kill. Lust is I think more of a physical energy. It's obviously sexual by nature. But I love the thinking behind lustful thoughts and lustful acts. Like in the book, there's a chapter where I go to Las Vegas and interview hookers at the Chicken Ranch, because I'm so fascinated by these women who are-- 
Do they have lust? 
Totally fine. You know what? They have lust enough to do it all day long. But their business sense was unbelievable when I sat down with them. All they are thinking about is money. You know, I thought maybe they might be thinking or getting off on it. Not at all. 
Are you, are you able, let's say you meet someone and you have lust? 
Yes. 
Are you able to separate that from love? 
Let me put on lip gloss and think about that one. I met someone, uh, uh, uh. Usually, usually there is a lustful attraction at first. I go, wow, look at that. And that---
You said that for Teletubby, too? 
You know, yeah, because there is-- 
Okay, I get it. 
I get lustful from energy.
All right.
That's what turns me on. 
And how do you separate it from love? 
That's where it can get a little muddy. But I think women can do it a lot better than men. Love comes in after the orgasm. That's-- 
After the loving. 
Yes, after the loving. 
It's a good song. 
Is it? I don't know. 
After the loving, I'm still in love with you. MCCARTHY: Oh, come on.
Remember, it was the great Engelbert Humperdinck. 
That was before my time, Larry. 
You really know how to hurt a guy. Okay, that's all right. It's all right, I can take it. I'm Jewish, we take it all the time. You say women are masters of manipulation. 
Yes.
How true.
Isn't it?
Why do you do that? 
You know, I wasn't aware of it until I was kind of busted by a therapist. But we do it so well, too. It is like we do the guilt treatment. We do the silent treatment to get what we want. 
That's the best. What are you mad at? Nothing. 
Nothing. Fine. You know what, fine. We will go. I will sit here and not do anything. 
like, come on, "Dancing With the Stars" is on. I'm going to uh-uh, just to get you there. 
So I feel like we do manipulate to get what we want. What I talk about in the book is maybe become aware and awake while you are doing it, so you might just be truthful instead of trying to trick your man. 
Do you wish you had testosterone? 
I think I have a lot of it. 
I wouldn't bet against it. Jenny's good friend, Chelsea Handler. We know her. She joins us after the break.
I was on MTV for about two weeks. I hit my first red carpet. And I remember getting all dressed up and standing there, and the photographers wouldn't take a picture of me. (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (EXPLETIVE DELETED) 
and they all started taking my picture. And the next week, I started to go. So I'm sure you guys recall -- I mean, that's all I did for years. 
Chelsea Handler is a comedienne, host of E's "Chelsea Lately." a major "New York Times" best-selling author. If you have as much luck with this book as Chelsea has with hers -- she is on the phone with us right now. What do you think of Jenny's new book? 
Well, I just went on Amazon and bought 150 copies. I hope that does it. 
Oh my God, I love you. 
You like it. 
Yeah, I love it. We talked about it a lot while she was writing it. She called and e-mailed me. We talked back and forth about it. Obviously, I am really funny, so I was trying to help her, because it's actually kind of like a helpful book. But I wanted her -- I wanted it to be as funny as she is. 
So we talked a lot about it. We have a lot to talk about. 
Do you agree with the concept of the book? 
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we're master manipulators. Girls are faking lots of things, Larry. You should know that. 
She actually helped me rewrite a chapter in the book. Yeah, the lady bits. 
Does Jenny ever give you advice, Chelsea? 
Yeah. She has given me a lot of advice. We are pretty good friends. 
Like? 
We both came out of relationships kind of at the same time. So we kind of both decided to have -- kind of decompress at the same time. We bonded over that. And you know, she -- I taught her how to dance, because I am a really good dancer. 
She did. She taught me this one. 
I like Chicago, where she is from. So we just have a lot of things that are pulling us in the same direction. 
Do you both think that men and women can be just friends? Do you think so, Jenny? Just friends? Two attractive people? 
I do. 
I do. I am friend with a lot of guys, and just friends. 
Go out to dinner with them? MCCARTHY: Yeah. even if I got really drunk, I wouldn't even think about it. There are just guys that go down the line as friends. And some that you go a little bit further. 
I feel the opposite, Larry. When -- I am friends with people most of the time. But if I do have a lot to drink, then I probably will have sex with them. 
That's true. 
You agree that women are the masters of manipulation, Chelsea? 
Yes, absolutely. 
OK. And you are both beautiful. You're smart. You re famous and funny. Do you think you intimidate men? She's Jenny -- I think you say you do? Do you think you do, Chelsea? 
Yes, I don't know if I just intimidate them or annoy them. But either way, it is not going great. 
She is a pretty strong cookie, I must say. 
Has she changed since she got famous. 
Chelsea? 
Yeah. 
I have only known her famous. 
You have been in the public eye a lot longer than she. But she has burst on the scene. . 
I met her -- in the Motherhood, we both did a web show together. She hasn't changed a bit. 
Maybe the question you should ask, Larry, is has Jenny changed since I became famous? 
Oh. 
The answer is yes. 
That's true. . 
Do you envy her? 
Chelsea has brought so much laughter into my life, especially during the autism years. Like I was shooting and really worried about Evan having seizures when I was working with her. She was always there for me. She has done so many contributions to autism. I consider her one of the first friends I would call if I got arrested. She is the greatest girl I know. 
Have you envied her success a little? 
Are you kidding. I call her. I sent her flower. I say, you know, we don't have men in our lives. Someone needs to send you flowers. I am so happy for your success. She deserves everything, because she gives so much to people. Even some people I would disagree with who she gives so much. 
Jenny is seeing a guy now, kind of likes him, right? 
I do. I really like him. 
So you are in love, but -- 
Yeah, I just started, Larry. I don't know. 
Chelsea, you got a man in your life now? 
No, I don't. 
How can you not have a man in your life, Chelsea? 
I don't. I don't know. Find somebody for me. I don't have a man. 
When was the last time you went on a date? 
Have I been on a date? 
How recently? 
It's been a couple months. 
Have you ever gone out a Teletubby, Chelsea? 
No, I have not. Actually, kind of. No, no, I have never gone out with a Teletubby. I do have to say -- 
Jenny has. 
I do want to say this. I want to say that the thing with Jenny and myself and how we have such a good friendship is because we are so similar and we are also very different. But just in support of -- in respect of both of us being authors and both of us being on TV and both of us doing different things -- it is very nice to have a friend that you are so similar to, that, you know, you don't have, you know, invidiousness towards. 
I'm happy about her success and vice versa. That is really an important message for women too. I tell all my fans I want them to buy the book. They're like, oh, we love that you are such good friends. We truly are really great friends. 
Chelsea, thanks. MCCARTHY: She feels a sister. 
Thanks Chelsea.
Thanks Chelsea.
Thanks, Larry. Good luck with everything. 
Chelsea Handler. Hey, one of the people who knows Jenny best, her sister Jojo. Next. 
Jojo. 
So cute. 
The book is "Love, Lust and Faking It." Jojo McCarthy is Jenny's younger sister. She's a celebrity makeup artist and she works on "Dancing With the Stars" and is a former professional basketball player. 
Uh-huh. 
What is it like being her sister? The truth. 
Truth. I really enjoy working with her, because I have learned so much watching her. And she's -- you know, she has taught me a lot as far as the business. So I look up to her. 
You are not on the air? 
Well, I did a little bit of QVC International. And she actually helped me become like my own TV personality. 
You sold a product? 
I did. 
What do you make of this book? 
I love it. I love it. And I am proud of her. Because some of the things that we are different in she has now achieved. Like, for instance, like the faking it -- you know, I'm really aggressive when I meet a guy. 
You are not married either? 
No, dating. But I'm like saying hi, my name is Jojo. I don't want a commitment. KING: You say this, hello. When he says hello? 
This is exactly what I say. I don't want a commitment. If I need my space, give me my space. I have stomach problems so I flatulate a lot. That's what I say. 
Then do you find they're suddenly gone? 
A few did. But the one that I'm with now for two years, he was like, OK. So I was like --
Do you know him?
Yes, and it's true, because I learned a lot from her, because she goes into relationships, like she said, book, it's her authentic self. She doesn't fake it. 
You had never done that? 
I had never done that before. So I do -- I definitely learned from her, and watch her and go, wow. And the guys respect it. Guys really like the honesty. I looked at that going, oh, I can really learn from her. 
Was it difficult having a very -- you are very attractive, but having a sensational looking sister. 
You know, growing up in Chicago and seeing her face plastered against the magazines, I couldn't be more proud. You know, I get that question a lot. Do you envy her career? No. 
Watching Jojo grow up, she was the star of the family throughout our entire life. She was like Michael Jordan of basketball. I am not kidding. 
Who did you play for? 
Chicago Condors. It was the ABL. 
I remember that. Red and white ball. 
Yeah, yeah, Larry, go. 
I am a fan. 
I think we are a lot like the Kardashians in terms of closeness, but we have smaller butts and saggier boobs. But we do have that bond of love that I think you can see in each other. 
Are your parents alive? 
They are. 
How did they deal with all of this. 
At first, back in the "Playboy" days, it was a bit rough. 
Risque, yes. 
But now they're not surprised by anything she does. They fully support her. 
They do. I was the black sheep, but --
Do you do her makeup? 
I do for the last 13 years. 
Does a good job. Why do you keep putting lipstick on by yourself? Why do you walk around with a lipstick? 
I just want to make you squirm, Larry. If I just keep putting lipstick on, you are going to love it. Right? 
There is something wrong with your right eye. We'll be back with Jenny McCarthy and Jojo McCarthy. The book, "Love, Lust and Faking It." Don't go away. 
We're back. Let's take -- we'll take another King-Cam question. This is from someone in L.A. asking advice. Watch. 
Hi, I want to ask, where would I find a good man. OK? I am having the hardest time finding a good, intelligent, kind, generous man. 
You are talking to two people with the same problem. But go ahead. 
That's very funny. You know, Jojo actually taught me something well, which is you hang out at the places that best reflect you. 
Where do you hang out? 
She found her man at Whole Foods, because she is really into nutrition and health. 
He was checking out. You were checking out. 
Then we were checking out each other. I followed him around the aisles. 
You followed him? 
I did. It was the first time I have ever really approached a man. KING: Whole Foods. You? Where do you go? 
Me, I literally put out a beacon. 
Where, the gym? 
Anywhere I'm at. The airport, on the plane, at McDonald's. Anywhere, as long as I'm meeting the best reflection of would I am now. I notice if I am not in a good place, I bump into people and things happen to me that reflect my kind of despair. But if I'm really happy and filled with love and complete, I'll meet a guy that's pretty great. 
Were you the first to know she was doing "Playboy?" 
I was. She came from the photo shoot, walked up the stairs and said I'm Miss October. 
Were you shocked? 
I was shocked, but I also was happy for her. But then I was like, oh, no. Mom's going to die. 
How did mom react? 
Not so well. 
How did dad? 
Fine. He was like, go Jen. 
Had you ever -- you never posed nude before? 
wasn't that hard to do? 
It was really hard to do. You know, my dad worked three jobs to put us through Catholic school. My mom, very religious. I was fearful the whole time I did it. I thought I was going to burn in hell. But for some reason, I listened to my emotional guidance system. And my instinct said, you know what, this is a launching pad to get out of debt from college, which was 20,000 dollars, get to L.A., 
And it was actually really good what I call like sorority. There were some great people, executives at "Playboy," that kind of looked after me when I got to L.A. Because getting off the bus there, a little scary. A lot of creeps. So they were a really good foundation for me to launch my career. 
Did you like the pictures? 
I loved them. Yes, I couldn't be prouder. 
Did it launch her career? JOJO MCCARTHY: I believe. So I definitely believe that. 
Well, there are many, many playmates. Right? 
Right. 
What do you think singled her out? Not many have launched careers out of "Playboy."
Growing up with her in the house, she always had that personality of wanting to be on camera. She had the microphone. We did talent shows. She was the school teacher. Like every time we played, she was the leader in it. So I wasn't surprised. 
Do you remember her first boyfriend. 
Oh, yeah. 
Broke her heart, didn't he? 
He did.
Are you south side? 
South side. We are tough south side girls. We had to fight, you know. 
South side is very different from the north side, right? 
It is. 
J. Blue collar, south side. 
It's a rough hood, you know? I got in many fights. Not many people know this. I don't think I talked about it. But I've been in some fist fights growing up. 
With boys and girls? 
With girls, with girls. The girls were really tough. 
High school? 
Yes. Jo-Ann remembers. In grammar school and high school, they'd follow me home, lit my hair on fire. 
Where did you live? 
We lived off of 57th and Polaski. Polaski. Down by the south side bar. 
Thanks for joining us, Jojo. 
Thank you so much.
We're going to do one more segment with her. Do you like doing "Dancing With the Stars?" 
I love it.
Some of them are a little bitchy, aren't they?
Wait, hold on, Larry. @BrownBunsTan, she spray tans her body. Had to plug it. Don't edit it out there. That was her plug. . 
We won't. 
Good. Just making sure.
Our remaining moments with Jenny McCarthy after this. 
Magnetic waves, brain cells, I don't understand the connection between all that stuff. 
You know what else I heard? Magnetic waves shrink silicone molecules. Ah! Oh, my god, turn it off. 
It's not working. 
It's backwards. 
What do I do? 
I don't know! Ah! 
This hour has gone by much too fast. Let's take a look at another -- a New York King-Cam question. This one is about infidelity. Watch. 
Hi, Jenny. I have a question for you. How does a guy know when his girlfriend is cheating on him? 
You know, I can't speak for men. But I can give you my opinion, which is -- 
Have you cheated?
I have cheated like in my 20s, but not since then. I don't know if I've been cheated on, but I don't think so. But I think we all have, like I talked about before, that emotional guidance system. We can kind of tell something's off. If you listen to that, and maybe do a little investigation, you might find that to be true. So your instincts I think are the most powerful tool to find out. 
Trust your instincts. 
Absolutely. 
What if you're wrong, though. It gets bad. 
Well, you know, I think you need proof in order to come down on anybody. If you don't have the proof -- 
Are you flirtatious? 
Am I flirtatious? Larry, what are you talking about? 
Doesn't that cause men to be a little jealous? 
You mean like my boyfriend to be jealous?
Yes.
I don't know. I think -- 
If you're in a restaurant and you're dining with a guy and you're doing this and that. 
I don't necessarily think I would do that. If I was with somebody I was really interested, my eyes are here. And I am a really good devoted girlfriend when I'm in it. 
What's with the Oprah thing? Do you have a deal with her production company? What's the deal? 
The deal is --
Harpo.
Harpo Productions. I will be doing a syndicated daytime talk show. 
On her network? 
Not on her network, syndicated like -- 
Like "Dr. Phil?" 
Uh-huh. Next year. 
What's the concept?
Just like your show. Just kidding. It's kind --
You want to buy this set?
I was thinking about it. I'd make it pink. So -- I want to be, you know, inspirational. I want to be funny. KING: Have guests? 
Have guests, but have a lot of kind of more experts. I love learning. I love takeaway TV. So -- 
That's what Oprah likes. 
Yeah. I definitely -- with her leaving, I want to kind of plug into that great gift she has of knowing what kind of the world needs to hear. 
Do you want a studio audience? 
I think so. I prefer, to be honest, this kind of intimacy. But I think daytime, it's kind of good to interact with the women. And I'm good with talking with my girls. 
Would you like another child? 
Wow, Larry, that's a good question. 
That's why I asked. 
I don't know. I believe in whatever happens is for the best reason possible. And if I get a little bun in the even, I will absolutely carry that through. But I am not looking for it right now. 
Did you enjoy pregnancy? 
I hated it. It was the worst thing ever. 
Why? 
My body was just not built for it. I think it's because I have a lot of testosterone, I wasn't meant to carry a child. My ribs popped out -- 
You should have been a guy. 
That's what my sister Jojo -- Jojo is nodding over there. Yes, I should have been. Me and Chelsea should have been dudes. 
I -- it was a horrific experience. But it allowed me to write an amazing pregnancy book called "Belly Laughs," which women still love. And I realized I kind of had to go through every single horrific thing in order to write about it. I couldn't leave out one thing out, and kind of the universe -- God gave me the disastrous pregnancy. 
Do you like doing books?
I love it. You want to know why?
Why?
Because I have so much to say. 
You're kidding. 
And I don't get censored. Like, I've been doing failed pilots for the past 14 years, sitcoms, where I'm trying to be this character that's really strong and voice my opinion and kind of kooky and different. And everyone's always tried to censor it. And books, they really allowed me to speak my mind. 
Thank you, as always, doll. 
Larry.

Hey there!
