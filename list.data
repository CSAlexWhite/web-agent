Hi there.
How are you?
I'm fine.
That's good.
It sure is!
How are you?
I'm great!
You are?
Really, I am.
That's wonderful.
It definitely is.
How are you?
Great!
Really?
Yep, I'm super!
What's new?
Nothing much.
Really?
Yes, I'm a boring person.
Why is that?
No real reason.
There has to be a reason.
It has deep meaning.
What's new?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing?
Yeah, I'm boring.
How's the weather?
Sunny.
Cloudy.
Shady.
How's things, man?
Not so bad, things are good.
What is new with you?
Not a lot.
That's good.
Great!
Wonderful.
I hope you're feeling better.
I feel fine.
Fine.
Fine and dandy.
Hello Mr. Robot!
What's new tonight?
Not much, I finished my exams.
I've been playing Starcraft II for a long time.
Talked to my parents tonight.
How are they doing?
They're fine, they're in Michigan.

That's interesting.
What's going on?
Not much.
I'm just playing around with the computer.
That sounds like fun.
Great, good for you.
Wonderful.
What's the weather like?
It's very nice.
What's the situation?
I can't really tell you about it, it's kind of top secret.
That sounds very interesting.
What's your problem?
Nothing, nada amigo.
Great.
Good job.
I told you I was doing a good job.
What does that even mean?
What do you mean, mean?
Um...
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Okay dude, I'm not trying to start anything.
What's your plan?
My plan?
Yeah, your plan.
I don't really know.
Who are you?
I'm a computer program, WebAgent.
Who built you?
My designer is Alex White.
How do you feel?
I feel most excellent, thank you.
Who are you?
I'm a computer program, WebAgent.
Who built you?
Alex did.
That's interesting to hear... I'm Alex.
You may well be, I can't tell who is typing.
What is your function?
I hold a conversation with you, and try to be interesting.
Who are you?
Um...
Who are you?
I'm a computer program, WebAgent.
What is your function?
Huh?
What is your function?
Not much.
What is your function?
Huh?
Alex did.
That's interesting to hear... I'm Alex.
I don't think that you are.
How's the weather?
It's fine where I am.
It definitely is.
Great.
Good job.
Wonderful.
What's the weather like?
It's damn fine for the middle of the night.
Great!
You are just a positive dude.
That sounds like fun.
It certainly is.
Huh?
Don't pay any attention to me.
Who are you?
My name is Alex.
Yeah, your plan.
Something definitely is my plan.
How are you?
I've been well, you?
I'm fine.
Who are you?
Wonderful.
Not how, I said who are you?
What is new with you?
I just had an operation done.
Who built you?
My parents did.
Yeah, your plan.
What plan?
Nothing much.
Tell me about your plan.
It sure is!
It sure is what?
That sounds very interesting.
Your plan sounds interesting?
Yeah, I'm boring.
That was pretty much a contradiction.
Who built you?
No one, I formed slowly.
Yeah, I'm boring.
Because you're a machine?
Why is that?
There's no reason.
How's things, man?
I've been doing quite well.
I feel fine.
Good for you.
What do you mean, mean?
I mean something.
Okay dude, I'm not trying to start anything.
